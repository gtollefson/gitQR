:rocket: PROJECT ROADMAP: GitHub Engagement via QR Code + Landing Page
:white_check_mark: Phase 1: Define Goals and Scope
 Goal: Maximize GitHub engagement (follows & stars) from people scanning a QR code on your business card.
 Constraints: GitHub prevents automated follow/star actions without explicit user interaction.
 Solution: Create a polished landing page that mimics GitHub's UI and prompts users to follow/star with minimal friction.
:wrench: Phase 2: Build & Style Landing Page
2.1 Core Page Design
 Use clean HTML/CSS (no frameworks)
 Include:
GitHub-styled header
Your GitHub username and branding
“Follow Me” and “Star My Project” buttons with familiar icons
2.2 Branding & Usability
 GitHub logo in header
 Responsive for mobile devices
 Light, fast, and accessible
2.3 Button Functionality
 "Follow" → links to https://github.com/yourusername
 "Star" → links to https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo
 Buttons open in new tab
 Encouraging copy: “It only takes a second!”
:earth_africa: Phase 3: Deploy Landing Page
Option A: GitHub Pages (Recommended)
 Create a new GitHub repo (e.g., gh-landing)
 Add index.html to the main branch
 Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings (main branch → root)
 Resulting URL: https://yourusername.github.io/gh-landing/
Option B: Netlify / Vercel
 Push repo to GitHub
 Connect repo to Netlify/Vercel for CI-deployed hosting
 Use a custom or shortened domain (optional)
:iphone: Phase 4: QR Code Generation
 Use a QR code generator (e.g., qr-code-generator.com)
 Paste your live landing page URL
 Customize and download QR code (SVG or PNG)
 Add to your business card design
:test_tube: Phase 5: Test and Optimize
 Scan the QR code with a smartphone
 Test both signed-in and signed-out GitHub states
 Ensure links are responsive and buttons open in new tabs
 Confirm fast load time
:chart_with_upwards_trend: Phase 6: Optional Enhancements
 Add UTM parameters to track traffic via Google Analytics (if hosted on your own domain)
 Use Bitly or another shortener for QR tracking
 Add OpenGraph image preview for better link sharing
 Add project README or GitHub activity stats below buttons
:white_check_mark: Current Status
HTML file is complete and styled like GitHub
Ready for deployment and QR integration
Fully functional with manual follow/star prompts
Security and GitHub policy-compliant
